1. Create a Spring Boot application with a simple REST API that allows users to register and login.

2. Implement JWT authentication for the API using the jjwt library. When a user successfully logs in, a JWT should be returned and saved in the user's browser as a cookie.

3. Secure an endpoint in your Spring Boot application using the JWT token. To do this, you will need to create a filter that intercepts requests to the endpoint and verifies that the request includes a valid JWT token. If the token is valid, the request should be allowed to proceed. If the token is invalid or missing, the filter should return an error.

4. Implement JWT token refresh in your Spring Boot application. This will allow users to refresh their JWT token without needing to re-enter their login credentials. You will need to create a new endpoint that accepts a refresh token and returns a new JWT token.
